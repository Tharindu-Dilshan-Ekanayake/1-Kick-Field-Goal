/**
 * The football field the lobby stands on: the plaza is painted as a pitch running north to
 * the KICK ZONE (so the start arch reads as the goalposts at the end of the field), with
 * mown bands, a white border, a royal blue end zone round the kick zone and a navy one
 * at the south end under the leaderboards ("KICK FIELD GOAL" in gold), a blue running
 * track down each side and a navy sideline apron beyond it where the treadmills, the ball
 * shop and the eggs stand - all in the venue's colours (sceneStyle VENUES: the home team's
 * royal blue, white and gold, or Palm Beach's turquoise, coral and sand). The circular BACKYARD STADIUM logo lies at the spawn, on the 50.
 *
 * Who draws what:
 *  - the colour areas (bands, end zones, border, track, apron) are painted into the
 *    ground map at one texel per unit (ground.js) - every edge on a whole unit, so crisp;
 *  - the lines (goal and yard lines, hash marks, the track's lanes) are thin white boxes
 *    in the world's block set (buildPitch), 0.04 above the ground;
 *  - the logo, yard numbers, end-zone lettering and direction stencils are decals in the
 *    painted-signs atlas (signs.js), 0.03 above the ground. Lines never run under a decal:
 *    they are cut round the logo, and the numbers and stencils sit between the lines -
 *    so nothing lies within 3 cm of anything else (no z-fighting, even on phones).
 *
 * The field's yard lines are 4 units (5 "yards") apart, counted from the north goal line:
 * the 50 is the line through the spawn.
